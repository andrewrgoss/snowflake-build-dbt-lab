[Snowflake Build 2021 - Accelerating Data Teams with dbt Cloud &amp; Snowflake](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/data_teams_with_dbt_cloud/#0)

Modern businesses need modern data strategies, built on platforms that support agility, growth and operational efficiency.

Snowflake is a data cloud solution that simplifies data pipelines, so you can focus on data and analytics instead of infrastructure management.

dbt is a transformation workflow that lets teams quickly and collaboratively deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation. Now anyone who knows SQL can build production-grade data pipelines. It transforms data in the warehouse, leveraging cloud data platforms like Snowflake.

In this lab I followed a step-by-step guide to using dbt with Snowflake and saw some of the benefits this tandem brings.

### What I Learned
